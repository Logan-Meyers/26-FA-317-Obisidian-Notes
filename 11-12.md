HW Hint:
1. Look at lecture notes on grammar to machine
2. Look at notes for machine to grammar
	1. Ex: delta(q_0, \*1, \*2) = {(q_0, \*1\*2)}
	2. Change to delta(q_0, Banana1, Banana2) belongs to (q_0, Banana1, Banana2)
	3. Translate to grammar rules
	4. => [q_0, Banana2, \*1] → Banana1[q_0, Banana1, \*2]...
3. so
	- L_1 and L_2 are reg, FA M_1 and M_2 to accept them
	- L_3 is c.f. Prove: write grammar or construct PDA. We construct PDA M_3 to accept L_3
	- LHS:
		- FA M_1, M_2
		- M_1 accepts x
		- M_2 accepts x^r 
	- RHS:
		- PDA M_3
		- M_3 runs on xx^r 
		- Stack with push and pop
		- M_3 says yes on xx^r 
	- Logic:
		- On input w, M_3 runs as follows: M_3 keeps reading the w and pushing each symbol read onto the stack. In parallel to this, M_3 runs FA M_1 on the symbol read. Some moments later, M_3 guesses it reaches the middle. At this time, M_3 makes sure that M_1 says yes already and then M_3 reads the rest of input while pop-comparing with the top of the stack. In parallel to this, M_3 runs FA M_2 on the rest of the input. At the end of w, M_3 says yes if M_2 and stack is empty.
4. Pumping Lemma proof

[FINAL EXAM PROBLEM] Let L_1 and L_2 be regular. Show that L_3  {0^n 1^2n : n >= 1, 0^n in L_1, 1^2n in L_2} is c.f.
