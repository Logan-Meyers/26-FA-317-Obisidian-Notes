DFA is valid if there is at most 1 outgoing state

0100101 in L(M)?

- A → B → D → D → C → B → D (accepting)

01001 in L(M)?

- A → B → D → D → C (not accepting)

Describe in mathematics what you want to build

Real-world: state transition systems, state chart, uml, etc

---

Programs as FA.

Map state → memory content

Input symbol → Input character

How to implement

```jsx
if b1 == 0 && b2 == 1:  // in state B
	read (”1”);  // crashes on 0
	b1 = 1;
	b2 = 1;
	// in state D
```

a DFA M with 2^k state == C program P with k bits of memory (k boolean variables)

---

Suppose program P has # 32-bit ints:

- 10: 320 bits
- 100: 3.2 KB
- 1000: 32 KB

Program P correspond to 2^3200 states

⇒ a DFA with 2^32000 states
(more that atoms in universe)

1. From a DFA you can write a regex for the language that is accepts
2. From a regex you can draw a finite automata out of it

Describe FA:

1. Draw
2. in English *
3. model

Model FA:

Read-only input tape, a string of inputs (ex. “abbaabbb”)

Controller/Machine stores code

That code is the program/FA scans from left to right only

machine also has memory

input changes content of memory
