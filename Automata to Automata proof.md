M' runs as follows:
- M' runs M faithfully, simulates M running on w.
- At the end, M' says yes on w iff M says yes on w and if ending letter == b.
- Clearly, M' accepts End(L, b)

Example: In CS,
- Let x be nonnegative int var.
- I have program:
	- x++;
	- x--;
	- If x falls below 0, program crash!

Blind counter: can't do text for 0 to avoid crash

(aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa)\*b
