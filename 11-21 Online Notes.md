Software Design:
- UML; we specify integer variables and operations. There is no alg to decide whether a UML design/spec is consistent or not
- VHDL & Verilog; use only finite ranged variables.

Counter: nonnegative integer variable with only operations allowed:
- x++;
- x--;
- x == 0?

all counters start at 0

How to use 317?
- Graphs are a universal data structure in Comp Sci. We can model programs as graphs. We can model data as graphs. 
- We can also understand graphs as FA (a program!). This can be used to model data & programs.
- EX: Given a regular language L, we can draw a FA M to accept L. the graph M can be used as a data structure for L. So FA can be used as a data structure for any finite set of strings or seq.
