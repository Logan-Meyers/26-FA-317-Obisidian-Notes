Homework 8 hint (**maybe put on cheat sheet**):
1. P1
	1. explicit construction → code of pda (delta)
	2. each 0 read, push 3 1's
	3. each 1 read, pop & compare stack
	4. delta(q_0, 0, z_0) = (q1, 111z_0)
	5. delta(q_1, 0, 1) = (q_1, 1111)
	6. write comments!
2. P2
	1. explicit construction
	2. describe how pda is going to operate
	3. hint: two modes; mode 1 read 0 = push 0, read 1 = pop 0; mode 2 read 1 = push 1, read 0 = pop 1
	4. when to switch: at mode 1 or mode 2, stack is empty, guess next mode
3. P3
	1. Examples: `0000001` or `0100110001`
	2. read 0, push 0
	3. read 1, pop 0
	4. at end, say yes
	5. words can't start with 1
4. P4 [FINAL TYPE QUESION]
	1. Proof (automata-to-automata construction):
	2. Draw left column (old):
		1. M accepts L
		2. Machine M runs on xy
		3. there exists a y s.t. M says yes on xy
	3. Draw right column (new):
		1. M' accepts Prefix(L)
		2. Machine M' runs on x, says yes at end if
		3. M' says yes on x iff there exists a y s.t. M says yes on xy
	4. M' is going to run on x, simulating M running on x as well. At the end of x, M' simulates M run by a guessed rest of the word. At the end, M' says yes on x if M' says yes on x and the guessed rest of the word.
	5. M' works on an input word x as follows: It faithfully simulates M reading the same input x. At the end of x, M' guesses, **symbol by symbol**, the y and feeds the y to M so that M continues to run on the y. Some moments later, M' guesses it's enough for guessing the y. At this moment, M' says yes (on x) if M says yes (on xy). Clearly, M' accepts Prefix(L)
5. P5
	1. we're on our own

Types of algs we know:
1. Given M, w in L(M)? Use Membership of PDA
2. Given M, L(M) = $\emptyset$? Use emptiness of PDA

C.F. Languages not closed under compliment and intersection, but they _are_ closed under union.

Let M be a FA. There is an alg to solve: whether there is a word w s.t. w in L(M) & \#a(w) = \#b(w)
w is not given as part of input, would have to check all possibilities nondet.ly. also could be $\infty$ amount of words to check, can't do that either
Proof:
- Consider a set L = L(M) $\cap$ {w: \#a(w) = \#b(w)}
- Observe that L(M) is regular (because FA)
- And observe {w: \#a(w) = \#b(w)} is c.f.
- So the L is c.f. and accepted by a PDA.
- The result (proof) follows since we have an algorithm to decide whether L is empty or not.

[FINAL EXAM PROB] Let G be a graph where each edge has a color. Multiple edges can share the same color. G has a start node and an ending node. Let w be a walk from start to end. We use \#red(w) for the number of red edges on the walk w. Show that there is alg to decide whether the is a walk from start to end satisfying \#red(w) = \#green(w).
[BAD SOLUTION] for given w, we need only check w is indeed a walk on G and \#red(w) = \#green(w). **!! w not given !!**
[BAD SOLUTION] enumerate all walks w from start to end and check conditions. **!! could have infinitely many walks to check !!**
[SOLUTION] define L_1 = the set of all color sequences on all walks from start to end in G. L_2 = the set of color sequences with \#red = \#green. Observe that L_1 is regular and L_2 is c.f. Therefore, L_1 $\cap$ L_2 is c.f. Notice that the result (fish) is true iff $L_1 \cap L_2 \neq \emptyset$. The result follows since we have an alg to solve $L_1 \cap L_2 \neq \emptyset$ ?

[FINAL EXAM] What if I change the constraint in prev prob from \#red = \#green to 2\#red > 3 \#green and \#red mod 17 = 2 ?

[XMAS BREAK PROB] Same setup as prev prob but now the constraint is: \#red = \#green = \#blue. Show an algorithm to check whether there is a w that satisfies. Above c.f. grammar : paragrammar/matrix grammar

Whole problem turns into Integer Linear Programming problem
By translating a graph into a linear integer system

Let P be a program like:
```
1: x++
2: if x==0 then goto 3 else goto 1
3: x--
4: goto 2
5. HALT
```
